# Welcome to Solaris!

Thank you very much for visiting our repository! The goal of Solaris is to develop and provide reusable code for amateur rocketry.
Through the different modules and the software architecture, our objective is to enable the rapid development of software for amateur rocketry teams that lack the time or resources to build it themselves.

## Installation
To use and compile the code, we have developed a Docker container with the latest ESPRESSIF image — the manufacturer of our boards.
However, this configuration can easily be adapted (by changing the Docker image) to any other board or architecture.
We use Docker as a common base so that all our developers share the same dependencies and can build code in a consistent environment.

We recommend reading our [installation guide for Linux users.](https://softwaresolaris.com/solaris/solaris-software/wiki/Installation-guide-for-Linux-users)

## Versions
We have currently two versions of our code: [solaris-v0.1](https://softwaresolaris.com/solaris/solaris-software/src/tag/solaris-v0.1) where we configure the BMP390 sensor and a [solaris-v0.2](https://softwaresolaris.com/solaris/solaris-software/src/tag/solaris-v0.2)

## Collaboration
We are open to you writing code in our repository, contributing your ideas or improvements — it is the only way to progress and be able to develop faster.
